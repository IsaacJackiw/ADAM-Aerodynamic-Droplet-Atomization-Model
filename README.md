# Droplet-and-Spray-Model


This project provides code for the models developed in the following works:

   - Jackiw, I. M., and Ashgriz, N., 2021, “On Aerodynamic Droplet Breakup,” J. Fluid Mech., 913(A33). https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2021.7
   - Jackiw, I. M., and Ashgriz, N., 2022, “Prediction of the Droplet Size Distribution in Aerodynamic Droplet Breakup,” J. Fluid Mech., 940, p. A17. https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2022.249
   - Jackiw, I.M., and Ashgriz, N., "Prediction of the Droplet Size Distribution From Twin-Fluid Sprays", submitted July 11, 2022

This code is made available for the purpose of sharing the contained models so that they can be more readily used and improved upon by others.
Any works that implement or build from this code should cite the above references.

The file "Breakup_Models.py" contains the models, while "Working Examples.py" provides basic working examples of their implementation.

The code was written by the author in Python 3.7.9 using the Spyder 4.2.0 IDE from Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/)
    and is not guaranteed to work on any other platform without modification.
    
Note: The author of this code is not a professional program developer.


Make it a great day,
